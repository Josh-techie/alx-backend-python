# Project: 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

## Overview

This project delves into the realm of variable annotations in Python. Gain insights into type annotations in Python 3, understand how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types, explore duck typing, and learn how to validate your code with mypy.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be proficient in the following areas:

- Type annotations in Python 3.
- Using type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
- Duck typing.
- Validating your code with mypy.

## Resources

To successfully navigate through this project, make sure to read or watch the following resources:

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet.html)

## Tasks

### 0. Basic annotations - add

Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes a float `a` and a float `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

The implementation for this task can be found in the file [0-add.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/0-add.py).

### 1. Basic annotations - concat

Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes a string `str1` and a string `str2` as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

For the implementation of this task, please refer to the file [1-concat.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/1-concat.py).

### 2. Basic annotations - floor

Write a type-annotated function `floor` which takes a float `n` as an argument and returns the floor of the float.

You can find the implementation of this task in the file [2-floor.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/2-floor.py).

### 3. Basic annotations - to string

Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns the string representation of the float.

The implementation for this task can be found in the file [3-to_str.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/3-to_str.py).

### 4. Define variables

Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:

- `a`, an integer with a value of 1.
- `pi`, a float with a value of 3.14.
- `i_understand_annotations`, a boolean with a value of True.
- `school`, a string with a value of "Holberton".

The code for this task can be found in the file [4-define_variables.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/4-define_variables.py).

### 5. Complex types - list of floats

Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` which takes a list `input_list` of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

The implementation of this task is available in the file [5-sum_list.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/5-sum_list.py).

### 6. Complex types - mixed list

Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` which takes a list `mxd_lst` of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

You can reference the implementation for this task in the file [6-sum_mixed_list.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/6-sum_mixed_list.py).

### 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple

Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an int OR float `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`. The second element is the square of the int/float `v` and should be annotated as a float.

For the implementation of this task, please refer to the file [7-to_kv.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/7-to_kv.py).

### 8. Complex types - functions

Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float `multiplier` as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by `multiplier`.

The code for this task can be found in the file [8-make_multiplier.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/8-make_multiplier.py).

### 9. Let's duck type an iterable object

Annotate the below functionâ€™s parameters and return values with the appropriate types.

The code for this task can be found in the file [9-element_length.py](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-backend-python/blob/master/0x00-python_variable_annotations/9-element_length.py).
